----------------------------------

**Groestlcoin done right**

The simplest and most secure groestlcoin wallet on any platform

![screenshot1](/images/screenshot1.jpg)

**The first standalone iOS groestlcoin wallet:**

Groestlwallet is a real standalone groestlcoin client. There is no server to get hacked or go down, so you can always access your money.
Using [SPV](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Thin_Client_Security#Header-Only_Clients) mode, Groestlwallet connects directly to the groestlcoin network with the fast performance you need on a mobile device.

**The next step in wallet security:**

Groestlwallet is designed to protect you from malware, browser security holes, *even physical theft*. With AES hardware encryption, app sandboxing, keychain and code signatures, groestlwallet represents a significant security advance over web and desktop wallets, and other mobile platforms.

**beautiful simplicity:**

Simplicity is groestlwallet's core design principle. A simple backup phrase is all you need to restore your wallet on another device if yours is ever lost or broken.  Because groestlwallet is [deterministic](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki), your balance and transaction history can be recovered from just your backup phrase.

**WARNING:** installation on jailbroken devices is strongly discouraged

Any jailbreak app can grant itself access to every other app's keychain data and rob you by self-signing as described [here](http://www.saurik.com/id/8) and including `<key>application-identifier</key><string>*</string>` in its .entitlements file.
